please keep in mind this is very buggy still and very much a demo


## what you need:

1. python (https://www.python.org/)
2. pip (https://pypi.org/project/pip/)

## steps

1. install tkinter.

```py
pip install tkinter
```

2. run the program in your console or in file explorer, both works.


## how to make your own sprites

you need 4 different GIF files, all 100x100 pixels. if you're too lazy to make GIF files, just rename your .PNG file to .GIF. has to be PNG though.

1. walking right (walking_negative.gif)
2. walking left (walking_positive.gif)
3. idle (idle.gif)
4. sleep / idle2 (sleep.gif)

replace the default images with your own and bam. you did it good job

## okay but how do I close the program i dont like using task manager every time

right click the little guy and press the "bye bye little guy" option. you're welcome
